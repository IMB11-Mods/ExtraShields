## Tips

- If you're fighting a player with Evokering, try to disable their shield with an axe before fully attacking!
- Evokering can be a great way to deal with multiple attackers at once.
- Evokering is extremely powerful with high durability shields, you essentially become a tank. As long as you avoid your shield being disabled, you can keep summoning fangs every so often.
