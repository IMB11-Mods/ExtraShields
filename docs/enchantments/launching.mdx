Launching is a **treasure-only** enchantment that can be found in ominous vaults. Shields with Launching will have a chance to launch the attacker away when the shield is disabled by an axe attack.

## Incompatibilities

Launching is not compatible with the following enchantments:

- [Lifebound](./lifebound)
- [Evokering](./evokering)
- [Momentum](./momentum)

## Chances

- **Level I**: 20% chance, weak launch - can launch the attacker up to 3 blocks away.
- **Level II**: 20% chance, medium launch - can launch the attacker up to 5 blocks away.
- **Level III**: 20% chance, strong launch - can launch the attacker up to 10 blocks away.

Each use of Launching will damage your shield by 5 durability points per level of the enchantment.

## Tips

- Launching can be a great way to create distance between you and your attacker, especially if you are low on health.
- Be careful when using Launching near ledges or cliffs, as you may accidentally launch yourself off.
- If you position yourself correctly, you can use Launching to launch your attacker into the air! This can be a great way to gain the upper hand in a fight as they will take immense fall damage.
- If you're fighting against someone with Launching, try to attack them from behind, or crouch and remain on the ground if you need to disable their shield - this will reduce the distance you are launched.
