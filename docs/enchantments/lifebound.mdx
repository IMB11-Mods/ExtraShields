Lifebound is a **treasure-only** enchantment that can be found in Nether Fortress chests. Players blocking with Lifebound enchanted shield will have a chance to absorb health from the attacker when blocking an attack.

## Incompatibilities

Lifebound is not compatible with the following enchantments:

- [Launching](./launching)
- [Evokering](./evokering)
- [Momentum](./momentum)

## Chances

- **Level I**: 25% chance to absorb 0.75 hearts.
- **Level II**: 30% chance to absorb 1.25 hearts.

## Tips

- Lifebound can be a great way to sustain yourself in combat, especially when fighting multiple enemies.
- Lifebound works from behind! If you're blocking and a player is attacking you from behind, you will still absorb health, meaning that any damage you sustain may be cancelled out by the health you absorb.
- If you're fighting a player with Lifebound, try to disable their shield with an axe before fully attacking! This will prevent them from absorbing health from you.
