## Tips

- Momentum can be a great way to escape from a fight or to chase down an enemy, get a friend to disable your shield and then chase your enemy!
- Be careful when using Momentum near ledges or cliffs, as you may accidentally run off.
- If you're fighting against someone with Momentum, try to attack them from behind to prevent disabling their shield.
- Whilst momentum might not be compatible with the other special enchantments, it can be combined with other enchantments such as Unbreaking or Mending to create a powerful shield.
