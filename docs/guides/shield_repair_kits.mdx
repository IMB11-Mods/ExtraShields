Shield repair kits can be used to quickly repair your shields without an anvil. Beware though, as these kits will permanently reduce the max durability of your shield by 25% each time you use it. You should only use these kits when you are in a pinch and need to repair your shield quickly.

## Crafting

You can craft a shield repair kit using a stick surrounded by 4 iron ingots.

## Usage

With your shield in your offhand, right-click with the shield repair kit in your main hand to repair your shield. The shield repair kit can be used up to a maximum of 4 times before it is consumed. There is a cooldown of one minute between each use of the shield repair kit.

## Tips

- Shield repair kits can be a lifesaver in a tough fight, especially if your shield is about to break.
- Be careful when using shield repair kits, as they will permanently reduce the max durability of your shield each time you use them.
- If you have the resources, it may be better to repair your shield using an anvil and the respective repair item to avoid the durability reduction.
