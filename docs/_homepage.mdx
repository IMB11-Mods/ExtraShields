## Mod Information

Extra Shields is a vanilla+ mod which aims to expand the shield system in Minecraft. It adds new shields, shield plating upgrades and new shield-related enchantments.

All the enchantments and platings are balanced around vanilla Minecraft, meaning that they are not overpowered and are designed to be used in survival mode. Balance is a key focus of the mod, and it is constantly being updated to remain inline with vanilla updates.
